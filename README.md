Vim terminal colorscheme based on BusyBee

This colorscheme emphasizes importance of lines of code. For example, functions are bright and bold whereas comments are very dark. Colors are picked to not conflict or be too gaudy.

Note that I use this in the terminal; thus, I do not know how good it looks in GVim, MacVim, etc.
